1.song title: On my way 
 Artist:Sabrina Carpenter & Alan Walker
 Lyrics:I'm sorry but
    Don’t wanna talk, I need a moment before I go
    It's nothing personal
    I draw the blinds
    They don't need to see me cry
    ’Cause even if they understand
    They don't understand

    [Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter]
    So then when I'm finished
    I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
    I'm taking my misery
    Make it my bitch; can't be everyone's favorite girl

2.song title: Bombo

 Lyrics:Come, come with me
    Let the light get you to where I want to be

    Don't deny what you want, we are young, we are free

    Mi amor, in your eyes
    I see love like a fire

    The night is young, my heart is light
    I know you wanna hold me so, boy, don't fight
    The night is young, you feel so right

 Lyrics:You know you love me (yo), I know you care (uh-huh)
    Just shout whenever (yo), and I'll be there (uh-huh)
    You are my love (yo), you are my heart (uh-huh)
    And we will never, ever, ever be apart (yo, uh-huh)
    Are we an item? (Yo) girl, quit playin' (uh-huh)
    "We're just friends" (yo), what are you sayin'? (Uh-huh)
    Said, "There's another" (yo), and looked right in my eyes (uh-huh)
    My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (yo, uh-huh)
    "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
    Like, "Baby, baby, baby, oh"
    I thought you'd always be mine, mine

4.song title: Lost in onstanbul
 Artist:Brianna
    Lyrics:Standing in the heavy rain
    I was someone I was not
    Freezing cold I follow
    The wind like an arrow
    It will lead me to you
    I'm lost in Istanbul (I'm lost in Istanbul, I'm lost in Istanbul)
    Ooh, na, na, ooh, na, na
    I'm lost in Istanbul (I'm lost in Istanbul, I'm lost in Istanbul)
    Ooh, na, na, ooh, na, na
    I'm lost in Istanbul
    Ooh, na, na, ooh, na, na
    I'm lost in Istanbul
    Ooh, na, na, ooh, na, na
    I'm lost in Istanbul
    Walking down the crowded streets
    I'm about to lose my mind
    City lights are drowned in darkn
